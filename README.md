## Business Problem

Manila experiences rapid shifts in property values due to factors such as urban development projects, changes in local ordinances, and shifts in buyer preferences. Staying abreast of these trends, and accurately predicting their impact on property values is a complex endeavor.

## Rationale for the Project

Multiple Linear Regression is a statistical method that enables the modeling of complex relationships between multiple factors and a single outcome variable. In the real estate domain, it allows for the consideration of numerous variables, such as property features and location, to provide a comprehensive approach to property valuation.

## Aim of the Project

The project focuses on utilizing a data-driven approach to property valuation at RealEstateBud in Manila. The primary goal is to create a robust valuation model utilizing Multiple Linear Regression, incorporating a number of factors. This model aims to significantly enhance the accuracy and transparency of property valuations, bridging the gap between estimated and actual property values.
